# PhD Level Astrophysics in a Nutshell

This document serves as a repository of astrophysics knowledge which I have gained during my time at Princeton University. In particular, this document will contain all the compiled information I have for 4 general subjects in astrophysics: Cosmology & Extragalactic Astronomy, Diffuse Matter in Space (The Interstellar Medium), Planetary and Galactic Dynamics, and Stars. These are the 4 core courses in the Princeton Astrophysics PhD Program. One must display a comprehensive and extensive understanding of these 4 courses in order to advance to candidacy. The exam has a duration of 2 hours and covers each of the 4 courses equally. 

Links to the 4 subjects are provided below:

[Cosmology & Extragalactic Astronomy](Cosmology_and_Extragalactic_Astronomy.md)

[Diffuse Matter in Space](Diffuse_Matter_in_Space.md)

[Dynamics](./Dynamics.md)

[Stars](./Stars.md)

By no means is this an exhaustive list of everything that must be known in generals or in the field of astrophysics, but it is a good overview of the most important things to know for the general exam. I warn the reader that some information may be incorrect in these documents as this has not been fact-checked or peer reviewed by others. This document is a snapshot of my level of understanding just after having passed my general examination. I also have not extensively cited or given proper credit to all figures or animations as I made this while studying for my exam and did not have time to carefully give proper and ample credit to every reference. 

Most of the information in this document can be found in these books

I strongly recommend Prof. Ryden's Ohio State Graduate Astrophysics series for Dynamics, ISM, and Stars. They are clear and concise. I read her dynamics textbook cover to cover to study for dynamics, not because I thought that was a good idea but the flow and progression of her book made it hard not to.
